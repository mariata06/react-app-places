        info: "Ajanta and Ellora are two monumental rock-cut caves that define Indian art and architectural accomplishment. Though these two monuments are separated by a distance of approximately 100 km, they are often mentioned together since their aesthetics and importance are at par and the fact that both are situated in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra. While Ajanta is mostly about beautiful paintings made on cave walls on the theme of Buddhism, Ellora is all about sculpture and architecture belonging to three different religions prevailing in the country during those times—Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism.",

They then spawned on their own, and now there are more than 1,200 monkeys living in herds on the island. That is the reason why this island is also called Monkey Island, besides its official name “Hon Lao”.",
